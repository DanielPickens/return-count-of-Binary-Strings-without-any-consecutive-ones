# return-count-of-Binary-Strings-without-any-consecutive-one


My Python solution will solve the following algo using Dynamic programming approach: 


Given a non-negative integer N return the number of binary strings of length N without 2 consecutive ones

Example:

Input: N = 3
Output: 5
Explanation: [
    "000",
    "001",
    "010",
    "100",
    "101",
]
Notes: N <= 30
